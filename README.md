The technical framework for this project involves using Java Spring Boot for the backend, Vue.js for the frontend, and MySQL as the database. It follows a front-end and back-end separation approach, where the frontend and backend are developed independently but communicate through APIs.
Key components of the technical framework:
Java Spring Boot: Spring Boot is a popular Java framework that simplifies the development of robust and scalable web applications. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and libraries for building backend APIs, handling data persistence, and managing application configurations.
Vue.js: Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces. It allows for the development of dynamic and interactive frontend components, making the user experience more engaging and responsive.
MySQL: MySQL is a widely used open-source relational database management system. It provides a reliable and efficient way to store and retrieve data for the application.
Package Dependencies:
The combination of Java Spring Boot, Vue.js, and MySQL provides a powerful and flexible foundation for developing a front-end and back-end separated project. Spring Boot enables efficient backend development, Vue.js allows for dynamic frontend interfaces, and MySQL serves as the reliable database. The additional packages and libraries mentioned provide utilities and features to enhance the development process.
